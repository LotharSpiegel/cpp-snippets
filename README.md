# cpp-snippets

A place where I gather small pieces of c++ as I start to (re)learn the language. Only interesting for beginners.
Most are standalone cpp files where I study some language feature or a certain class. I try to add as much helpful comments as possible - maybe that way the files can serve as a fast introduction for self-learners.

I use C++11 (maybe sometimes C++14?).
Some tips: if you use DevC++, you could need to add the command -std=c++11 under Tools->Compiler Options to get them running in case a file uses C++11 language features.
